# News Feed Feature

## Overview
The GUI has been updated to display related sections in a scrollable news feed format, similar to social media feeds. This eliminates the need to click on individual files and provides an intuitive way to browse through all related content.

## Key Features

### 1. **SNS-Style News Feed**
- All related sections are displayed in a single scrollable feed
- No need to click on files to view content
- Automatic sorting by similarity score (highest first)

### 2. **Full Content Display**
- Shows complete section content without truncation
- No text size limits - scroll to read everything
- Full markdown rendering with proper formatting

### 3. **Markdown Rendering**
The feed properly renders:
- **Headers** (H1, H2, H3)
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Inline code` and code blocks
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Blockquotes
- Tables (if markdown library is installed)

### 4. **Visual Design**
- Card-based layout with shadows and borders
- Color-coded similarity badges:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** (70%+): High similarity
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange** (50-70%): Medium similarity
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** (<50%): Low similarity
- File name and section headers clearly displayed
- Keyword tags for quick reference

### 5. **Smart Layout**
- Left panel: Target file content (editable)
- Right panel: News feed with all related sections
- 40/60 split ratio optimized for reading

## How to Use

1. **Select Target File**: Choose the markdown file you want to analyze
2. **Select Comparison Files**: Choose files or directory to compare against
3. **Calculate Similarity**: Click the button to analyze
4. **Browse the Feed**: Scroll through the news feed to see all related sections
   - Each card shows the file name, similarity score, section heading, and full content
   - Keywords are displayed at the bottom of each card
   - Content is automatically sorted from most to least similar

## Technical Details

- `markdown>=3.3.0`: For advanced markdown rendering (optional)
- Falls back to basic regex-based rendering if not installed

```

Or install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Benefits

## Example Use Case
