- **Reinforcement schedules**
- Extinction and spontaneous recovery
- Generalization and discrimination

### Cognitive Psychology

Study of mental processes:

- **Information processing**
- Memory and attention
- Problem-solving and decision-making
- Language and thought
- Cognitive biases

### Psychoanalytic Theory

Unconscious mind and early experiences:

- **Id, Ego, Superego**
- Defense mechanisms
- Psychosexual development
- Dream analysis
- Modern psychodynamic approaches

### Humanistic Psychology

Focus on personal growth and self-actualization:

- **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**
- Carl Rogers' person-centered approach
- Self-concept and self-esteem
- Free will and choice
- Positive psychology movement

## Developmental Psychology

## Sensation and Perception

### Sensory Systems

#### Audition

- **Sound wave** frequency and amplitude
- Pitch and loudness perception
- Localization of sound
- Music and language processing

#### Other Senses

- **Touch**: Pressure, temperature, pain
- Taste: Five basic tastes

- Proprioception: Body position

### Perceptual Organization

- **Gestalt principles**
- Figure-ground relationship
- Top-down vs. bottom-up processing
- Perceptual constancy
- Attention and selective perception

## Memory

### Memory Systems

#### Atkinson-Shiffrin Model

- **Sensory memory**: Brief storage (<1 second)
- **Short-term memory**: Limited capacity (7Â±2 items)
- **Long-term memory**: Unlimited capacity

#### Working Memory

- **Central executive**
- Phonological loop
- Visuospatial sketchpad
- Episodic buffer

### Memory Processes

- **Encoding**: Getting information in
- Storage: Maintaining information
- Retrieval: Getting information out
- Consolidation: Stabilizing memories

### Forgetting

- **Decay theory**
- Interference (proactive, retroactive)
- Retrieval failure
- Motivated forgetting
- False memories

## Emotion and Motivation

### Theories of Emotion

- **James-Lange Theory**: Physiological first

- Facial feedback hypothesis

### Motivation Theories

#### Drive Theories

- **Homeostasis** and drive reduction
- Optimal arousal theory
- Yerkes-Dodson law

#### Incentive Theories

- **Extrinsic motivation**
- Intrinsic motivation
- Self-determination theory
- Goal-setting theory

## Social Psychology

### Social Influence

- **Conformity**: Asch's line studies
- **Obedience**: Milgram's experiments
- Group dynamics and groupthink
- Social facilitation and loafing
- Persuasion and attitude change

### Social Cognition

- **Attribution theory**
- Fundamental attribution error
- Self-serving bias
- Stereotypes and prejudice
- Implicit biases

### Interpersonal Relations

- **Attraction** and relationships
- Love (Sternberg's triangular theory)
- Prosocial behavior
- Aggression
- Conflict resolution

## Personality

### Trait Theories

#### Big Five Model

- **Openness**: Creativity, curiosity
- **Conscientiousness**: Organization, discipline
- **Extraversion**: Sociability, energy
- **Agreeableness**: Compassion, cooperation
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional stability

### Other Approaches

- **Psychodynamic**: Unconscious processes
- Behavioral: Learned patterns
